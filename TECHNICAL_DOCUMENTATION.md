### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with Vite for fast development and building
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with shadcn/ui components
- **Blockchain**: Solana Web3.js for blockchain interactions
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana Wallet Adapter for multi-wallet support
- **Protocol**: Honeycomb Protocol Edge Client for game-specific blockchain operations
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development server and optimized production builds

## Honeycomb Protocol Integration

The integration with Honeycomb Protocol is handled through a dedicated service layer that abstracts the complexity of blockchain interactions from the React components.

### HoneycombService Class

The `HoneycombService` class in `src/lib/honeycomb.js` provides a clean interface for all Honeycomb Protocol operations:

```javascript
class HoneycombService {
  async initialize()
  async createProject(adminPublicKey)
  async createCharacter(walletPublicKey, characterData)
  async createMission(missionData)
  async startMission(characterAddress, missionAddress)
  async completeMission(characterAddress, missionAddress, rewards)
  async updateCharacterXP(characterAddress, xpGained)
  async getCharacterProfile(walletPublicKey)
}
```

### Protocol Features Utilized

1. **Character Manager**: Creates and manages on-chain character NFTs with programmable traits
2. **Mission System**: Implements verifiable mission logic with automatic reward distribution
3. **Profile Management**: Stores player progression data in compressed on-chain accounts
4. **Resource Management**: Handles XP and other game resources as on-chain tokens

### Fallback Strategy

The application implements a graceful fallback strategy when Honeycomb Protocol is unavailable:

- **Primary**: On-chain storage via Honeycomb Protocol
- **Fallback**: Local storage for development and testing
- **Indicator**: Visual status indicator shows current storage mode

## Component Architecture

The application follows a hierarchical component structure with clear data flow and responsibility separation.

  <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
    <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
      <WalletModalProvider>
        {children}
      </WalletModalProvider>
    </WalletProvider>
  </ConnectionProvider>
)
```

### Connection Management
