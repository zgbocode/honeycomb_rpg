# Honeycomb Protocol Integration Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to how Honeycomb Hero integrates with the Honeycomb Protocol to enable on-chain gaming features. The integration demonstrates the practical use of Honeycomb's core modules for character management, mission systems, and player progression.

## Honeycomb Protocol Features Used

### 1. Character Manager

The Character Manager module is used to create and manage Digital Druid characters as on-chain assets.

#### Implementation

```javascript
async createCharacter(walletPublicKey, characterData) {
  const honeycombCharacter = {
    name: characterData.name,
    specialization: characterData.specialization,
    level: 1,
    xp: 0,
    traits: {
      [characterData.specialization]: 1
    },
    walletAddress: walletPublicKey.toString(),
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
  };

  // Create character using Honeycomb Protocol
  const result = await this.client.createCreateCharacterTransaction({
    data: {
      name: honeycombCharacter.name,
      project: HONEYCOMB_CONFIG.projectAddress,
      authority: walletPublicKey.toString(),
      // Additional character configuration
    }
  });

  return {
    characterAddress: result.characterAddress,
    character: honeycombCharacter,
    success: true
  };
}
```

#### Character Traits System

Each Digital Druid has programmable traits that determine their abilities and mission access:

- **Code-Weaver**: Technical proficiency, security awareness, debugging skills
- **Community-Tender**: Leadership, communication, governance expertise  
- **Chain-Healer**: Crisis management, forensic analysis, recovery protocols

These traits are stored as on-chain metadata and can be evolved through gameplay.

### 2. Nectar Missions

The mission system leverages Honeycomb's Nectar Missions for time-based challenges and reward distribution.

#### Mission Pool Creation

```javascript
async createMissionPool() {
  const result = await this.client.createCreateMissionPoolTransaction({
    data: {
      name: "Digital Druid Missions",
      project: HONEYCOMB_CONFIG.projectAddress,
      authority: adminPublicKey.toString(),
      characterModel: characterModelAddress.toString(),
    }
  });
  
  return result.missionPoolAddress;
}
```

#### Mission Implementation

```javascript
async createMission(missionData) {
  const result = await this.client.createCreateMissionTransaction({
    data: {
      name: missionData.title,
      project: HONEYCOMB_CONFIG.projectAddress,
      cost: {
        address: resourceAddress.toString(),
        amount: "0", // Free missions for MVP
      },
      duration: missionData.duration.toString(),
      minXp: missionData.requirements.minXp || "0",
      rewards: [
        {
          kind: RewardKind.Xp,
          max: missionData.xpReward.toString(),
          min: missionData.xpReward.toString(),
        }
      ],
      missionPool: missionPoolAddress.toString(),
      authority: adminPublicKey.toString(),
    }
  });

  return result.missionAddress;
}
```

#### Mission Execution Flow

1. **Mission Start**: Player selects mission and sends character on mission
2. **On-chain Recording**: Mission start recorded with timestamp
3. **Duration Tracking**: Honeycomb tracks mission duration automatically
4. **Completion**: Mission completes after specified duration
5. **Reward Distribution**: XP automatically distributed to character

### 3. Profile Management

Player profiles store progression data and achievements using Honeycomb's compressed profile system.

#### Profile Creation

```javascript
async createProfile(walletPublicKey) {
  const result = await this.client.createNewProfileTransaction({
    project: HONEYCOMB_CONFIG.projectAddress,
    wallet: walletPublicKey.toString(),
    profileIdentity: "main",
    customData: {
      gameVersion: "1.0.0",
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      achievements: [],
      statistics: {
        missionsCompleted: 0,
        totalXpEarned: 0,
        favoriteSpecialization: null
      }
    }
  });

  return result.profileAddress;
}
```

#### XP and Achievement Tracking

```javascript
async updateCharacterXP(characterAddress, xpGained) {
  // Update character XP
  const xpResult = await this.client.updateCharacterXp({
    characterAddress,
    xpGained,
    authority: playerPublicKey.toString()
  });

  // Update profile statistics
  const profileResult = await this.client.updateProfile({
    profileAddress,
    customData: {
      statistics: {
        totalXpEarned: currentXp + xpGained,
        missionsCompleted: currentMissions + 1
      }
    }
  });

  return { xpResult, profileResult };
}
```

### 4. Resource Management

The game uses Honeycomb's Resource Manager for XP and future in-game currencies.

#### Resource Definition

```javascript
async createXpResource() {
  const result = await this.client.createCreateResourceTransaction({
    data: {
      name: "Experience Points",
      symbol: "XP",
      decimals: 0,
      project: HONEYCOMB_CONFIG.projectAddress,
      authority: adminPublicKey.toString(),
      // Resource configuration
    }
  });

  return result.resourceAddress;
}
```
